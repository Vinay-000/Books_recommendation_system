   - This will clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Set Up the Environment:
   - Navigate to the cloned repository directory:
     ‘’’ cd Books_recommendation_system ’’’

   - It's recommended to create a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies. Run the following commands to create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
     - On Windows:
       ‘’’python -m venv env
       .\env\Scripts\activate ‘’’
     - On macOS and Linux:
       ‘’’ python3 -m venv env
       source env/bin/activate’’’

3. Install Dependencies:
   - To install the required Python dependencies, run the following command:
     ‘’’pip install -r requirements.txt’’’

4. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   - Run the following command to start Jupyter Notebook:
     ‘’’ jupyter notebook’’

5. Access the Book Recommendation System:
   - Once Jupyter Notebook starts, your web browser will open with the Jupyter Notebook interface.
   - Navigate to the cloned repository directory and open the Jupyter Notebook file named `book_recommendation_system.ipynb`.
   - Follow the instructions and code cells in the notebook to explore and interact with the Book Recommendation System.
- For Demo simply run the file app.py 

6. SQL Integration (Optional):
   - If you plan to integrate the recommendation system with a SQL database, make sure you have the necessary SQL server installed and configured.
   - Modify the code in the notebook or create additional scripts to establish the connection and perform the required SQL operations.

That's it! You have successfully installed and set up the Book Recommendation System. You can now explore the Jupyter Notebook, interact with the system, and customize it further according to your needs.

Please note that these instructions are just a sample, and depending on the specifics of your project, you may need to modify or add additional steps.

##Usage
•	Explore Book Recommendations.
